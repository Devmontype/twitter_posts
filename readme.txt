1.To run this project npm,node must be installed in machine


2.To Install all npm packages of this project run `npm i` command

3.After that run the project using `npm run dev` or `npm run start` command

4.I have used remote mongodb,so no mongosb needed locally.If you want to run it in local mongodb just change the connection in `config/db.js`
  file and in `index.js` file.
